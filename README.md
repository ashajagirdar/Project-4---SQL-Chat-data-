# Project-4---SQL-Chat-data-

**Project Overview**

This project was done for a company called **ChatData**, a popular network of question-and-answer (Q&A) websites in the fields of data analytics, data science and artificial intelligence. They help budding data analysts stay up-to-date with current innovations, find answers to burning questions, and stay active in the data community


**Project Objectives**

The main objective for this project was to answer a few questions regarding user activity and interaction on the ChatData site. In order to do this, I:

- Created an ERD.
- Created an SQLite database and load the data.
- Created single table queries to analyse engagement.
- Created cross table queries to analyse engagement further.
- Checked the queries table to ensure you have recorded all the queries.
- Created a Powerpoint Presentation to Present to the Stakeholders 

**What tool was used for this project?**
The main tool that I used to conduct analysis was **SQL**, but this was done through the Jupyter Notebook. I had to partially use Python too. Also, Microsoft Excel was briefly used in terms of transferring the data into SQL.
